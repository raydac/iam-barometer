Some Android devices have a barometer sensor on board. I have one such device and wanted an application which could show hPa, mmHg and approximate altitude in meters over the sea.

Because it is developed it for my own purposes, I have not published it into the Play store. It can be downloaded only as pre-built APK for Android 10+.
